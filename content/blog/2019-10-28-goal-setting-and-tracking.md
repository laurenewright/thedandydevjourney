You have a ton of resources to choose from and you have a passion to DO ALL THE THINGS! But hold on now. Don’t get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of stuff you can do and things you want to learn. Take a step back. Take a look at everything. Then pick one or two things out of all of that to focus on. This is important, as you are one person. You can only do and learn so much.You have a ton of resources to choose from and you have a passion to DO ALL THE THINGS! But hold on now. Don’t get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of stuff you can do and things you want to learn. Take a step back. Take a look at everything. Then pick one or two things out of all of that to focus on. This is important, as you are one person. You can only do and learn so much at a time.

But if you are like me, then you won’t be able to just leave those other things to the side. You want to get back to them after all. In that case, which is often the case, I take stock of everything that I’ve collected: resources, project ideas, tutorials, etc, then I throw them all into lists. Specifically Trello, but I think any list app that you can check on the go will be most invaluable. I like to add things to my list as I come across things I want to look at more thoroughly in the future if I don’t have the time currently, for example. Lists are one of my favorite things, only after checking things off a list. The trouble you might come across now is: ALL of the lists you have now! That’s where some goal setting and planning is key. And it’s cousin: time management.

I have a job, but thankfully I’m not in school too and I have no kids so I have more free time than some. I cherish the free time I have and do my best to use it to it’s fullest. For me this means giving myself some daily, weekly, and monthly goals. These goals can be incredibly mundane depending on the day and my energy levels. Sometimes it’s just: journal, read a tech article, and exercise. Some days I have way more mental and physical energy to accomplish more which is great, but I always try to be mindful of how I’m feeling on any given day.

Below I want to go over some of my usual goals. Things to help give you an idea of what you want your own goals today.



On the daily goals! 



1. Try to learn one new concept

2. Read one new tech article

3. Assess your progress

4. Try to watch one instructional video

5. Try one coding challenge

6. Read over your old code

7. Plan out your next monthly project

8. Record your progress

9. Work on one problem from your monthly project 



Weekly goals!



1. Make some progress on your monthly project

2. Plan out this month's project

3. Complete all daily goals for x days

4. Complete x amount of coding challenges

5. Complete x amount of tutorials

6. Refactor some old code in your project

7. Read over the code in your monthly project

8. Record out your weekly progress



Now to monthly goals!



1. Complete one small project a month

2. Go to at least one meetup

3. Track your progress on your monthly project

4. Complete x amount of weekly goals 

5. Record out your monthly progress

6. Record out your successes

7. Record out your struggles

8. Record what you've learned



You'll notice that a lot of these goals are about recording your progress. For me, this blog is just that. A way to track my progress and write out my thoughts on development. You don't have to have a blog of course. It can be a document on your computer or even in a journal if you want. The point is to see how you've grown. When you have a crappy day where you can't figure out that problem no matter how hard you try, look back at how far you've come. Look at all that you've learned! And yeah, you might look back at your notes and think some of these things are easy now, but remember: they weren't easy for past you and you still made it through.

That's my challenge to you, dear reader. Keep track of your goals, your progress, your struggles. Memory can be fickle, but words live forever.
