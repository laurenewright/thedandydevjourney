> I was on Facebook, like you do, when I came across a post about a former coworker and friend talking about the local bootcamp Code Louisville. It struck me. I don't know why I looked into it further. Curiosity. About the program, about what my potential could be.
>
> So I signed up. Eh, there's probably a waiting list. I'll get in there eventually maybe. I put it away from my mind and went back to my life of making coffee and lattes.
>
> Then I got an email. I felt lighter. This is going to be so cool! I quickly signed up on my phone while on my break. Later, I messaged my friend and we chose the same class day! I was very excited for my first day at something new.
>
> Something new indeed! I had dabbled in web development for a whole semester in college and decided that it was cool, but I was almost done with my Anthropology degree and going a year over as it was so I guessed it wasn't in the cards at the time. I don't even have the files to my first website anymore, but I remember it was a website about the current wonders of the world and my website used frames.
>
> Before even my first day at Code Louisville, we were instructed to go through several hours of pre-course work. It was then when a lot of the stuff I had learned in that college class came flooding back. I also had two realizations one: there's a lot more to making websites than that class touched on, and two: this is going to be a lot of information to process in a very short amount of time.
>
> I was ready.
>
> I remember studying late into the night. Staying up late to watch my course videos. Watching them on my breaks at work. Studying as much as I could to make this change in my life reality.
>
> And oh boy did the Code Louisville open my eyes to all the different possibilities there are. I didn't feel held back anymore by my circumstances. The community and mentorship I found there fueled my passion for learning even when I got hard.
>
> It's still hard sometimes, but I know that I can reach out to for assistance. People I would have never met had I not seen a friend's random Facebook post.
